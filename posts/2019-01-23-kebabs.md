# Ingredients 

* Ground Beef
* Onions, diced
* Salt
* Mint (finely chopped fresh or dried)

# Steps

* Prepare all your fresh ingredients
* Mix ingredients with ground beef
* Shape mixture into patties or place on skewers
* BBQ until cooked to your liking

# Notes

Serve kebabs on pita bread or over rice with your favourite salad (tabouleh, fattoush, etc) and sauce (muhammara or taziki).

If your ground beef is dry,  adding a small spoon of olive oil to add fat and flavour.

Other herb alternatives to mint include fresh parsley or fresh basil.
